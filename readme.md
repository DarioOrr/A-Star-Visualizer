# This is an A* Algorithm Visualizer

## Getting Started
Clone the reposititory, and head to the directory in which the clone is stored in your terminal.  To download the required library (pygame),
type pip install -r requirements.txt

## Using the Visualizer
Simply type python3 astar.py to get started.  Your first two clicks will be your start and endpoints.  To draw a startpoint, click anywhere on the grid.  To select an endpoint, click anywhere.  To create a barrier, click and drag anywhere on the screen.  To change a barrier or start or endpoint, simply right click the block you wish to change.  Once you are ready, press the spacebar.

It is quicker if you tap the spacebar repeatedly rather than wait once you initially press the spacebar.  To reset the grid, press "C".
